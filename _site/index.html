      <h3>What is it?</h3>
<p class="lead">Each Occupy.here router is a LAN island in an archipelago of affiliated websites.</p>
<p>Anyone within range of an Occupy.here wifi router, with a web-capable smartphone or laptop, can join the network “OCCUPY.HERE,” load the locally-hosted website http://occupy.here, and use the message board to connect with other users nearby. The open source forum software offers a simple, mobile-friendly interface where users can share messages and files.</p>
<p>The project has developed in parallel with the Occupy movement and seeks to offer a network of virtual spaces where both committed activists and casual supporters can communicate.</p>
<p>Due to its distributed and autonomous design, Occupy.here is inherently resistant to Internet surveillance. Building up a collective network infrastructure that is owned and controlled by its users can lay the groundwork for other uses and applications. We don't have to choose between abstaining from social media and entrusting our data to corporate interests. We just need to take a greater responsibility for our own online services.</p>

  <h3>The idea</h3>
  <p>The project started in October 2011, with the goal to create a written supplement to the spoken conversations in Liberty Square (aka Zuccotti park). I wasn’t able to spend as much time in the park as I wanted, so I thought about how I might connect with others who passed through intermittently via an “offline forum.” Restricting the forum to those within the local wifi range created a self-selecting audience, and also (perhaps) created one more incentive to visit the occupation.</p>
  <p>Since Liberty Square has been cleared and the Occupy Wall Street movement is now more decentralized, the goals for the project have adjusted. Instead of (or, perhaps, in addition to) augmenting the experience of being in an OWS encampment, we are building an archipelago of virtual spaces to host conversations similar to those in Liberty Square. More than ever, both “activists” and ”non-activists” alike need to have spaces for open discussion.</p>
  <p>The new focus is to <em>create a distributed network of wifi locations</em>, each serving those in its immediate vicinity. These separate networks will soon be able to connect to each other, although that functionality is still under development.</p>
  <h3>How you can help</h3>
  <p>The project seeks collaborators of all kinds. You can help <a href="https://github.com/occupyhere/occupy.here">write the code</a>, <a href="https://github.com/occupyhere/occupy.here/wiki/How-to-build-Occupy.here">build and host your own wifi node</a>, or simply <a href="https://lists.riseup.net/www/info/occupy.here">participate in the conversation</a>.</p>
  <p><a href="http://phiffer.org/">Dan Phiffer</a> is the founder and lead developer, with further contributions from GitHub user <a href="https://github.com/Phaeilo">Phaeilo</a>. You should join us!</p>

        <p>What an amazing weekend we had at <a href="http://prismbreakup.org/">PRISM Breakup</a>! Thanks so much to the organizers, <a href="http://deweyhagborg.com/">Heather Dewey-Hagborg</a>, <a href="http://www.allisonburtch.net/">Allison Burtch</a>, <a href="http://aureliamoser.com/">Aurelia Moser</a>, and <a href="http://nas.sr/">Ramsey Nasser</a>. It was easily among the best art/tech events I&#39;ve been to, and a pleasure to be involved.</p>

<p>I just uploaded a screencast from the workshop on Sunday, that you can <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=594FFypUDYo">watch on YouTube</a>. Thanks to everyone who came out, and especially to those who took an Occupy.here router home!</p>

              <p>After very helpful early feedback from Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/pe5pe">@pe5pe</a>, we discovered that release 1 had a couple serious flaws:</p>

<ol>
<li>The way we were setting up the initial network configuration was kind of a bad idea</li>
<li>We omitted a key file in the release, <a href="http://downloads.occupyhere.org/opt.img">opt.img</a> (which is too big to store in GitHub!)</li>
