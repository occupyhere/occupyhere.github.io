Release 5 was intended to introduce a major new feature, however it is not quite ready yet and we're a month out from the last release. There is still a lot in this one:

* Fixes and improvements in the install.sh script
* Spanish language translation (thanks [@pe5pe](https://twitter.com/pe5pe)!)
* Many other details

If you speak another language, and want to help internationalize Occupy.here, please get in touch!
