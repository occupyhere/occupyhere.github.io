title:  Release 2
---
After very helpful early feedback from Twitter user [@pe5pe](https://twitter.com/pe5pe), we discovered that release 1 had a couple serious flaws:

1. The way we were setting up the initial network configuration was kind of a bad idea
2. We omitted a key file in the release, [opt.img](http://downloads.occupyhere.org/opt.img) (which is too big to store in GitHub!)
