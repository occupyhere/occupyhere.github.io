title:  Release 7
---
Almost as soon as I'd uploaded yesterday's release number six, I realized the newly added Library feature had a serious flaw in how it handled imported HTML files. This bugfix release addresses that and a security vulnerability I discovered in the Library code. Be sure to update if you installed release number six!
