title:  Release 6
---
Two new features and one major bug fix in this Thanksgiving day release number six. The Spanish translation I thought was working in release 5 had some problems, but this one should address them. Onto the new stuff:

1. You can now change where users get redirected to when they request plain "http://occupy.here/" (previously they'd always get sent to the Forum page). Just go to the admin page and look for the "default path" setting.
2. I've beefed up a feature that hasn't been enabled by default until now: a Library collection for HTML articles and PDFs. For now, to add new material you have to copy files into the top-level 'import' folder on the USB memory stick. The next release will make it possible to download content straight from the Internet via Ethernet.
