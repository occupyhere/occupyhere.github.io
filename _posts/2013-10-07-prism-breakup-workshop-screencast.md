title:  PRISM Breakup workshop screencast
---
What an amazing weekend we had at [PRISM Breakup](http://prismbreakup.org/)! Thanks so much to the organizers, [Heather Dewey-Hagborg](http://deweyhagborg.com/), [Allison Burtch](http://www.allisonburtch.net/), [Aurelia Moser](http://aureliamoser.com/), and [Ramsey Nasser](http://nas.sr/). It was easily among the best art/tech events I've been to, and a pleasure to be involved.

I just uploaded a screencast from the workshop on Sunday, that you can [watch on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=594FFypUDYo). Thanks to everyone who came out, and especially to those who took an Occupy.here router home!
