title:  Release 3
---
The third release is here! We’ve fixed some snags that a few people were reporting with the install script (no more need to download opt.img). There’s also a new administrative section:

1. You can now easily backup the data from your router as a zip file
2. Administrators can delete posts
3. There is now an easy way to change the wifi network name and URL
